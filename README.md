**Lesson's topic:**

OOP basics: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.

**Task:**

1. Take as a basis the result of an easy homework assignment.
2. Let's improve our author. Let it inherit from the Human class. Let Human have only a first and last name (and getters, setters for them). Let the Worker class be inherited from it, and let one more method be added to it - createSignature(), i.e. subscribe, which returns a String with the last name and first name.
3. And now this Worker needs to be used for the author field.

**Result:**
